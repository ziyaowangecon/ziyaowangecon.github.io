## About Me
I am a PhD candidate in Economics at [Northeastern University](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/economics/). I am on the 2025–2026 job market.

My research spans **Industrial Organization**, **Development and Growth**, and **Applied Econometrics**, with a special focus on *Productivity*, *Technological Change*, *Market Power*, and *Economics of AI*.

My work explains where firm productivity growth comes from—which inputs, which technologies, and which policies. I develop and estimate structural models that capture firm behavior and market structure, and provide evidence-based insights that speak to reform design, technology (AI) adoption, and business strategy.
