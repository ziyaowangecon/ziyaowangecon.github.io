  <div class="abstract">
    This article identifies firm-level factor-augmenting productivity for capital, labor, and materials using Chinese manufacturing data from 1998 to 2008, a period of state-owned enterprise reform. We develop a novel method to estimate the parameters of a CES production function and recover the three types of factor-augmenting productivity. Results suggest technological change is strongly biased: labor-augmenting productivity grew 12% annually, capital-augmenting 5%, and material-augmenting 1.4%. Factor-augmenting productivity growth varies by sector and ownership. Productivity growth was driven primarily by incumbents, whereas entrants improved capital efficiency and exiters enhanced labor efficiency. We explain factor cost-share shifts through productivity gaps and relative input prices.

  <div class="abstract">
This paper studies how artificial intelligence (AI) adoption affects firm-level productivity in South Korea. Using a 2017–2023 panel covering all major market sectors, we combine direct survey measures of AI adoption with a structural model of endogenous productivity to address selection into adoption. We find AI adoption raises revenue-based productivity by about 5% on average, with substantial heterogeneity by time since adoption that is consistent with a delayed J-curve, by sector with the largest gains in ICT and short-run losses in manufacturing, and by application area with gains concentrated in product/service development and sales and marketing rather than production processes. Using the estimates, we also examine how AI adoption relates to market power.

### Privatization, Market Power, and Non-neutral Technological Change in Chinese Manufacturing

  <div class="abstract">
This paper examines how ownership transformation during China’s state-owned enterprise (SOE) reform affected the direction of firm-level technological change. Using Chinese manufacturing data from 1998–2008, I estimate a nested CES production function with factor-augmenting productivities and embed privatization directly into the law of motion for each productivity to address endogenous ownership change. I also relax perfect-competition assumptions in labor markets by allowing ownership-specific rent sharing, which separates true labor-augmenting technological change from wage markdowns. Using the estimates, we quantify how privatization shifts labor-augmenting productivity and compare labor market power between SOEs and private firms.
    
<!--The estimates indicate that privatization significantly accelerates labor- and capital-augmenting productivity, with more modest effects for materials, and that SOEs and private firms differ systematically in their labor-market power.-->
