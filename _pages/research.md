### [Non-neutral Technological Change in Chinese Manufacturing](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5176447) **[Job Market Paper]**

Abstract: This paper develops a novel method for estimating production function with firm-level factor-augmenting productivity, for capital, labor, and materials inputs. Using Chinese manufacturing data from 1998 to 2008, a period of major SOE reforms, the results reveal strong evidence of biased technological change:  labor-augmenting productivity grew fastest (12.2% annually) and was the most persistent, followed by capital (4.9%) and materials (1.4%). Sectoral patterns show significant heterogeneity. Dynamic Olley-Pakes decomposition indicates that productivity growth was primarily driven by survivors, while entrants improved capital efficiency and exiters enhanced labor efficiency.
